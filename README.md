- Favorite language: I've always loved HTML because to me, it's the absolute easiest, but I love C++ and Python also!
- Dream job: Anything that involves computers has always been my dream job, but if I'm honest, when I was a kid, I got super into computers because I wanted to be a hacker like Garcia from Criminal Minds!
