# hello-world
I'm writing a description because the tutorial is saying I have to write a short description, woohoo! 
I'm Cassie Cantrell,
My favorite color is pink but it's hard to tell because I'm always wearing black, and
I have an addiction to buying books, but hey, I at least read them! I hope my son ends up loving to read as much as I do!!!
